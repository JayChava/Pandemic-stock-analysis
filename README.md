# Pandemic stock analysis
 ### Abstract
 Coronavirus the latest pandemic of the 21st century has impacted the stock market, unlike any other.
Before we start our deep dive into impact on the markets, below are the news which we are seeing all around us or are expected.

•	Business closures and manufacturing plant shutdowns

•	Job losses and an increase in the unemployment rate

•	Supply chain disruption

•	Shortages of daily essentials

•	Pressure on healthcare systems

•	Exponentially rising infection and death tolls

We see that a lot of non-essential shops are closing down, many manufacturing plants are shutting down which directly affects the life of daily wage workers . Unemployment has increased; Layoffs and uncertain furloughs are at an all-time high as companies are struggling to stay afloat. There is a disruption in the supply chain, and people are hoarding daily essentials including toilet papers. This will result in shortages. The number of cases related to infections is rising which is causing tremendous pressure on healthcare systems. The developed markets are coping somewhat with this unprecedented situation.
Combined with these are steep falls in financial markets. In these circumstances, the question which might come to you is when we can expect some good news, when will markets recover. Many industry sectors took a direct hit, quarantining has hurt the transport industry, as the whole industry came to a standstill. Other sectors like real estate and materials took an indirect hit as consumers become more stringent with their wallets.
